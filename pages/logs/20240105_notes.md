# January 5, 2024 - Notes

It's been a while since I updated my notes.  I'm mostly focusing currently on reorganizing the data so that it's easier to do large time-series analysis across a decade or more of Landsat imagery.  

I'm really disappointed with Landsat 7.  In 2003 the SLC failed, creating huge stripes in the data.
