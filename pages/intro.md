## Measuring Impacts of Urban Gardens using Remote Sensing Data

This project attempts to show impact of urban gardens in combating Urban Heat Island effects using by measuring and evaluating
Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) from USGS Landsat imagery, USDA NAIP imagery, Planet Corporation imagery, and various other Remote-Sensing data products.  

In the image below, we show LST showing 30+ degree (F) temperature differential at Colfax and Monaco.
