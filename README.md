## Overview

This is a simple workflow to take geospatial data surrounding the Denver Metropolitan area and analyze the impacts of Urban Gardens.   Key datasets currently include Landsat, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), and potentially NASA AVIRIS. 

## Workflow

I normally use C++ for professional workflows, but as this will likely get handed off to a data scientist, I want to stick with Python.  I'm using Jupyter Notebooks as simple cookbooks to show how I'm rendering this data. 

## Jupyter Book

I also want to capture the results of this process and publish a simple GitHub Pages site.  See https://marvins.github.io/DUG_WellnessIndex/intro.html.
